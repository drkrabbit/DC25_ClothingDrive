	* Honestly, this is just the beginning of what I am envisioning.  More than just helping to 
	* put clothes on the backs of the homeless and those in need, I think that we as the hacking
	* community can do incredible things for the communities that we interact with.  So, whether
	* we are descending upon Las Vegas, 30,000 strong or returning to our homes, let's continue
	* to have a positive impact.
	*
	* Next year, I will begin planning this out WAY earlier and I would also like to come up 
	* with something "bigger".  If you would like to participate, please message me on Twitter
	* and we can brainstorm to come back bigger and better at DC26.

						<h3>What's this all about?</h3>
						<p>
							As we begin packing our bags for Hacker summercamp and get ready to see all of our virtual friends in person, I have one quick favor to ask: If you are heading to DEF CON, please pack one extra piece of clothing. 
						</p>

						<p> Why, you ask?  Well, when you venture out of Caesars Palace during the conference, you will notice that there are many people on the street who are less fortunate and struggling.  And while at times it may seemt that there are a lot of people on the strip in need of assistance, it is only a small fraction of those that need help.  I think that as a community, we can accomplish incredible things.  We do more than just break things or get our lulz.  We are creators. We are innovaters. We are makers. And we are doers.  I firmly believe that we can create positive change in every community that we come in contact with.  So as we descend upon Las Vegas this year, let's do a little something for the community that has been hosting us for 25 years.
						</p> 
						
						<p>
							With that in mind, I have decided to organize a clothing drive to benefit Las Vegas homeless and domestic violence shelters.  I've reached out to a few local shelters, and am making arrangements to have our donations delivered to them so they can distribute the clothes to those who need them. <br/>
							As of right now, I am coordinating with:
							<ul>
								<li><b>Las Vegas Rescue Mission</b> - Providing hope and change to the homeless, addicted, and others in need.</li>
								<li><b>The Shade Tree</b> - A shelter for abused women and children.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					</div>

					<!--In fact, there will be free beer in it for you if you volunteer to help transport clothing!  -->
					<div class="row">
						<h3> Sounds great! How do I help?</h3>
						<p>
							There are a number of ways you can help! ^_^ <b>Since this is a clothing drive, we're mostly going to need people to bring clothes!</b>  Thus, if you have the room in your suitcase, please bring some new or gently used clothing that you would be willing to donate to the cause.  <br/><br/>Or if you fancy yourself a strong lad or gal who can carry a fully loaded server rack around the datacenter without breaking a sweat, your assistance in transporting the clothes to the shelters on Saturday would be GREATLY appreciated.  <br/><br/><b>If you would like to assist with logistics or have any questions, please reach out to me via <a href="https://twitter.com/drkR4bbit">Twitter</a>.</b>

<!-- Are you still looking for stuff to play with?  I mean, I guess I shouldnt be too surprised because I AM taking the time to actually write these messages to you.  Unfortunately, because I am setting this up so late,
I didn't have the time to do anything fun.  Next year, I'll throw a little something extra in here, k? Thanks!
